Contracts governing the Oasys ecosystem: A gradual transition from centralized governance by the Oasys Core Team to decentralized governance by Council members


## The Initial Governance Contract (v0)
This is the first iteration of our governance contract. In this version, only whitelisted callers have the privilege to deploy contracts. The specific details are as follows:
- Administrators are authorized to add or remove whitelisted deployers.
- Only those callers who are on the whitelist can deploy contracts on L1.
